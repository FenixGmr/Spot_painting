# Spot_painting
Â«Spot paintings " are the most recognizable and iconic works of Hirst after sculptures with animals. No one knows for sure , how many are there-presumably ,thousands. The earliest ones were created by the artist himself, later ones are already made by assistants under his supervision, what, of course, questions their value.  The cheerfulness of these canvases it would seem , contradicts Hearst's preoccupation with mortality issues. In fact, each composition mimics the molecular structure of a potentially deadly and addictive substance. which can only be obtained with a doctor's prescription. Thus, these pictures are a witty and sharp commentary on the multibillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry ,which sells medicines like candy (therefore, the cycle has a second name - "Pharmaceutical pictures").  This series is also Hearst's tribute to such colorists ,like Gerhard Richter and Mark Rothko.
